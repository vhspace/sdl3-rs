# SDL3 [![Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/sdl3)](https://crates.io/crates/sdl3) [![](https://dcbadge.limes.pink/api/server/https://discord.gg/RE93FmF6Um?style=flat)](https://discord.gg/RE93FmF6Um)



Bindings for SDL3 in Rust.

SDL is the [Simple Directmedia Library](https://www.libsdl.org/), a cross-platform library to
abstract the platform-specific details for building applications. It takes care of everything
from handling events, creating windows, playing audio, accessing device cameras and sensors,
locking, GPU access, and much more. See more here: [https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/APIByCategory](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/APIByCategory).

SDL officially supports Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android, and several other platforms.

## Migration Progress

Now that the SDL3 API is mostly stabilized, we are working on a new version of the Rust bindings for SDL3.
The migration is in progress, and we are looking for contributors to help us complete it.

Expect some bugs and [missing features](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/NewFeatures).
Feel free to create issues or work on them yourself.

- [x] Update all modules to SDL3, use new [sdl3-sys](https://github.com/maia-s/sdl3-sys-rs) bindings,
      follow [migration guide](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/docs/README-migration.md).
- [x] Fix tests.
- [x] Update examples to SDL3.
- [ ] Add [new features](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/NewFeatures) from SDL3.
- [ ] Update documentation.

Please refer to the [sdl3-rs](https://github.com/revmischa/sdl3-rs) repository for the latest updates.

The low-level bindings are being worked on in the [sdl3-sys](https://github.com/maia-s/sdl3-sys-rs) repository.

# Overview

This is an interface to use SDL3 from Rust.

Low-level C components are wrapped in Rust code to make them more idiomatic and
abstract away inappropriate manual memory management.

## Quick Start

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
sdl3 = { version = "0", features = [] }
```

## Linking to SDL3

This crate requires the SDL3 system library to link and run.

By default without any of these features enabled, it will try to link a system SDL3 library as a dynamic/shared library
using the default library search paths.

You may select how to link the library via features:

- `build-from-source`: Fetch and build the library from source. Recommended if you just want it to work and don't have
  SDL3 installed system-wide.
- `build-from-source-static`: Fetch and build the library from source and link it statically.
- `use-pkg-config`: Use `pkg-config` to find the library.
- `use-vcpkg`: Use `vcpkg` to find the library.
- `static-link`: Link the library statically.
- `link-framework`: Link the library as a framework on macOS.

You can read more about these options [here](https://github.com/maia-s/sdl3-sys-rs/tree/main/sdl3-sys#usage).

# Contributing

We're looking for people to help get SDL3 support in Rust built, tested, and completed. You can help out!

Many examples and documentation requires updating. Interfaces have changed from SDL2 to SDL3, and the Rust bindings need
to be updated to reflect these changes.

If you see anything wrong, missing, or suboptimal, please feel free to open a PR with your improvements.

# History

This project was forked from [Rust-sdl2](https://github.com/Rust-sdl2/rust-sdl2) and the SDL2 code migrated to SDL3
according to the [SDL2->SDL3 migration guide](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/docs/README-migration.md).

If you want a library compatible with earlier versions of SDL, please
see [Rust-sdl2](https://github.com/Rust-sdl2/rust-sdl2).
